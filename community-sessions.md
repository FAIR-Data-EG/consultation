# Background

The [FAIR Data Expert Group](http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3464) is requested by the European Commission to develop a plan how the FAIR principles can finally be put into action and change our data practices. The group identified 9 focus points that the report should include, and we started mentioning relevant points for all these focus points to kick off a broader discussion. Therefore, we launched this Call for Contributions (which is also available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/pdf/fair_eg.pdf)). Some of you have already responded to it, and we are thankful for that, while inviting further responses.

Knowing that the terminology to describe aspects of the data landscape is so diverse and that conceptualisations differ dependent on the background of the interested stakeholders, we did not want to only rely on written statements, but to also offer verbal interaction possibilities. Therefore, the following sessions have been scheduled where members of the expert group will be available to listen to your issues and to discuss all aspects which are relevant to fulfill the group's mission.

# Times

- on Monday 3rd July from 14:00-16:00 CEST and
